                        <p>the reason I like Nino paid is because his music is real, it relates to so many including me,
                he speaks from his heart and makes it relatable. One of my favorite songs is joeys story which is a song about mens mental health.</p>

                <p>Another one of my favorite artist is Future he music is really good and just a really catch and he has been in the game for a really long time.</p>
                    
                <p>the last one is brent he makes rnb and is one of the best artist out right now. </p>
