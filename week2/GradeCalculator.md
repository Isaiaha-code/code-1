1. How does an if-statement work? An if-statement checks whether a condition is true. If it is, the code inside the if block runs. If it's not true, that code is skipped.

2. What is an if-statement used for?
An if-statement is used to make decisions in code. It lets the program choose different actions based on conditions.
3. Describe how an else-statement works.
An else-statement provides an alternative block of code that runs when the if condition is false.
4. What does the elif statement do? elif stands for "else if". It lets you check multiple conditions in sequence. Only the first True condition runs, and the rest are skipped.
