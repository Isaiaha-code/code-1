An if statement checks whether a condition is true.
If the condition is true, the code under the if block runs.
If it's false, Python skips that block.

An if statement is used to make decisions in your program.
It lets your program respond differently depending on different situations.

An else statement provides code to run when the if condition is false.
It is optional and always comes after all if/elif conditions.

elif means "else if".
It's used when you want to check multiple conditions, one after another.
